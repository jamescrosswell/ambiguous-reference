# Ambiguous Reference

This is a Minimal Reproducible Example of an error we're seeing when trying to build the Sentry .NET SDK with `.net 9.0.100-preview.7.24407.12`.

We're seeing multiple instances of this error when building `Sentry.Bindings.Cocoa.csproj`, which is the bindings project we have to wrap the Sentry Cocoa SDK for `net8.0-ios` and `net8.0-maccatalyst`:
```
/Sentry.Bindings.Cocoa/obj/Release/net8.0-ios/iOS/Sentry.CocoaSdk/SentrySpan.g.cs(362,4): error CS0104: 'RequiredMember' is an ambiguous reference between 'Foundation.RequiredMemberAttribute' and 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RequiredMemberAttribute'
```

If this were code that we were writing, we might be able to fully qualify the references or add a using alias or something. However since the code is in the `*.g.cs` files that get generated by the Xamarin bindings, I think this is an issue with `xamarin / xamarin-macios`.

## Building/running the example

I've been running the following from the `zsh` terminal on an Apple M2 running macOS Sonoma 14.6.1:
```
dotnet build Sentry.Bindings.Cocoa.csproj -c Release --no-restore --nologo -v:minimal -flp:logfile=build.log -p:CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies=true
```

The command may be more complex than necessary, but I'm wanting to replicate exactly what gets run by Sentry's github runners in CI.
